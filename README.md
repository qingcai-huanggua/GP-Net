<h2> GP-Net: A Lightweight Generative Convolutional Neural Network with Grasp Priority <h2>
Here we open source GP-Net related code, trained model and corresponding results.
The model here is further finetuned by us, and the effect is better than that shown in the paper.
<h2>DATASET<h2>
There are three datasets used in this paper. The REGRAD dataset can be downloaded from this URL: https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/zeuslan/dataset
